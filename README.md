Dear all, this is the temporary repository for prima.cpp. **Our prima.cpp has been open-sourced and has received 1k stars, thanks to the community developers for your interest.** Unfortunately, our main repository account was flagged by GitHub (due to refuting a politically sensitive repository `cirosantilli` on GitHub), and GitHub Support has not yet responded. As a result, prima.cpp is temporarily not accessible. When we can regain access depends on Github Support's work efficiency. Please stay tuned. 

However, if GitHub Support does not process our appeal, prima.cpp will become closed-source. We have lost the motivation to contribute to the open-source community (if Github Support don't recover our account).

Finally, we would like to remind you that, if you come across accounts or repositories like `cirosantilli` that spread political rumors, don't leave comments using your main account. These phishing, malicious accounts will lock and modify your comments, then report you to Github Support. Then, Github Support will lock your account, and it may take several months for them to process your appeal.


**Update**: The repository has migrated to Gitee: [gitee.com/zonghang-li/prima.cpp](https://gitee.com/zonghang-li/prima.cpp)
